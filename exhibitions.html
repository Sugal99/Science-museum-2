            <p class="cosmology_info">Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic 
                exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky.

                And what we can see and know about the universe 
                around us. We’ll locate the various constellations
                and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about 
                the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
                
                Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from
                early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the 
                latest
                exploration of the planets in our solar system.

            <img src="/images/Evolution.png" class="evolution_img hvr-float-shadow " alt="evolution image">
            <p class="evolution_info">For centuries, philosophers and scientists have
                wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do 
                we
                come from and how did we get here? 
                
                Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we 
                have had a
                framework for exploring and understanding our 
                place in this world. 
                
                Discover the origins of life on this planet and how 
                the species we know today have evolved our time.
                
                You can also take some time to meet a few of the 
                creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly
                Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs 
                too.</p>

            <p class="biology_and_medicine_info">From micro-organisms to the human body, major 
                breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique
                insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.
                
                For many people their life expectancy is much longer 
                and their quality of life much improved, thanks to
                the growth of our understanding of medicine. 
                
                Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of
                medicine and take a look at some major 
                breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin 
                and the first
                heart transplant.</p>
