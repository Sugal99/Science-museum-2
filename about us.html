    <p>Over the course of human history, science has developed from 
        our early understanding of fire, wind,
        water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to 
        the very building blocks of life itself.
        
        The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can 
        experience the wonders of our
        discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue
        the exploration of the world around
        us.
        
        We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but 
        brought to live through exhibits. This is
        why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied 
        subjects of science to explore. 
        
        Many of
        these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play 
        around to see science come to life (apart
        from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when 
        everyone’s gone home).</p>
